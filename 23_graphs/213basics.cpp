/* 
    examples:
            network of facebook friends
            network of cities
    nodes:
        vertex nodes
        connecting nodes
    edges:
        directional property
        weightage property
    
    types of graphs:
        on directionality
            directed - unidirectional edges
            undirected - bidirectional edges 
        on weight
            weighted graph - edges with weights
            unweighted graph - edges without weights

    storing a graph:
        1. adjancency list
        2. adjacency matrix
        3. edge list
        4. 2D matrix (implicit graph)
    
    --  adjancency list can be:
            1. list <list>
            2. array <list>
            3. vector <list>
            4. vector <vector>
