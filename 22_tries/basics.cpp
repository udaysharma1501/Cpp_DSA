/* 

    *** imp for pattern matching problems

    searching options: 
        1. brute force - linear search algo
        2. BST - height balanced BST (map) -- search in O(N) time
        3. hashing - unordered map (good approach)
        4. trie based approach - O(W) time
    
    prefix trie:
        - generic tree like data structure
        - efficient info retrieval 
        - searches in O(key lenght)
        - uses extra storage (tradeoff using brute force which will not use as much space but will work slower)

    operations:
        1. insert - a new word
        2. search - for a given word
        3. deletion - of an existing word
