/* 
properties:
    1. BST is a binary tree
    2. each subtree is also a BST
    3. all nodes in left subtree should have value >= value of root
    4. all nodes in right subtree should have value < value of root
    5. traversal
    - inorder: left -> root -> right 
    6. inorder taversal print of BST will always be sorted
    7. searching can be made efficinet as - we can check at every node weather our target node is greater, smaller or equal to the currnent node under inspection
