Optimized Bubble Sort
In simple bubble sort algorithm, the time complexity will remain O(n^2) every time, even if the given array is already sorted.
Your task is to optimized the bubble sort such that its best case time complexity becomes O(n).

Input Format

Output Format

Return an integer vector in non decreasing order.



Sample Input
{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}


Sample Output

{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}}


Explanation
